# ADSB Pi

![ADSB Pi](/resources/ADSBPi.png)

Welcome to ADSB-Pi!

This GitBook is designed to cover using the ADSB Pi utility to take a bare-bones Raspbian or Ubuntu ARM system and set it up as your ADSB (or ACARS, VHF Airband or even radio sondes!) base station using docker containers. All you'll need is a Pi, at least one SDR (Software Defined Radio), and some kind of antenna.

If that sounds all a bit confusing, don't worry! We'll go over everything you need to know.

## Who we are

We are a group of SDR enthusiasts who enjoy using our Raspberry Pis and SDRs. Most of the docker containers used are from [mikenye](www.github.com/mikenye), and without them this project wouldn't be needed. The [ADSB Pi project](https://github.com/fredclausen/adsb-pi) comes from discussions about bringing together Mike's work and making this as easy to setup and maintain, regardless of experience.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute and are experienced in Python and or shell scripting please see the [ADSB Pi project github page](https://github.com/fredclausen/adsb-pi). If you would prefer a less "code-y" way to contirbute you can look at the [ADSB Pi's gitbook repository](https://github.com/fredclausen/adsb-pi-book) and help keep this documentation up to date and helpful for all users.

## Where to find help or further reading

If you'd like real time (or as close to) support with the ADSB Pi utilities or with the docker containers themselves you can head over to [Mike's discord server](https://discord.gg/sTf9uYF) where there are plenty of people around to lend a hand. No question should go unanswered so please feel free to ask away.

If you prefer a more hands-on way of installing of this please visit [Mike's ADSB Gitbook](https://mikenye.gitbook.io/ads-b/) where he covers all of the steps that ADSB Pi automates.

## Where to go from here

In this guide we'll go over what you need to do before running the utility as well as running the tool and what to do after.

If you are new to this world and want to start right at the basics please check out the Primer section. Also, you can check the [glossary](#glossary) if there are any terms you aren't sure of. Otherwise, if your a veteran of Pis and docker, head on over to [hardware preparation](preparation/hardware.md) or [installation](#installation) to get started!
