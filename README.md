# ADSB Pi

Welcome to ADSB-Pi!

This GitBook is designed to cover using the ADSB Pi utility to take a bare-bones Raspbian or Ubuntu ARM system and set it up as your ADSB base station using docker containers.

If that sounds all a bit confusing, don't worry! We'll go over everything you need to know.

In this guide we'll go over what you need to do before running the utility, such as:

* Hardware
* Software

If you are new to this world and want to start right at the basics please check out the Primer section. Otherwise, head on over to [hardware preparation](preparation/hardware.md) to get started!
