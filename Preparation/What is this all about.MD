# What is this all about?

ADSB, or Automated Dependent Surveilance Broadcast, is a technology used by airplanes to provide Air Traffic Control and other planes in the air up to the second accuracy on position, altitude and speed. It in effect can replace the air traffic radar systems of old, as well as provide never before seen cockpit situational awareness to the aircrews.

One of the side effects of this that all of these ADSB positions are being sent all the time and anyone with the proper equipment can receive these positions and see what is going on around them. Addtionally, there are web sites where you can feed that information to. These websites generally provide a service with the information that is aggregated from all of the feeders, and the feeders usually get enhanced access on those websites that would normally have to be paid for.
